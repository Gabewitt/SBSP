# Space Based Solar Power (SBSP) -- Will SBSP be a viable energy source for a sustainable future?


### Description of the Project and Code

In this project I was task to display and explain the different possible designs for SBSP, and to identify which are more reliable by showing the advantages and disadvantages of each design. 

This code calculates the number of satellites one country would have to use depending on their energy needs. 

Be sure to use crountry codes when selecting which country you would like to see. For example:

France = FRA
Brazil = BRA
