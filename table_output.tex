\toprule
design & Discription & Features & Size & Weight & Energy Production & Cost \\
\midrule
Large array of solar panels & Placing large satellites in GEO, which captures solar energy using solar cells, converts the energy into RF signals, rectennas capture the RF signals to turn into electircal signals & Scalable & 1-5km & 10 000 - 100 000 tons & 1-5 GW & 20-500 billion \\
Sun tower & Cyclindrical modules stacked together forming a tower in LEO, where the tower spins on its axis to stabilize maintaining its orientation towards Earth and thefdes Sun & Scalable and in LEO & 1-2km height & 5 000 - 20 000 tons & 0.5-1GW & 10 - 100 billion \\
Modular Symmetrical concentrator & Large modular array that concentrates solar light into small specific spot, often being a high efficiency solar cells or even heat engines in GEO. Energy is converted to RF and transmitted to Earth & Scalable and flexible deployment & 1-2km diameter & 10 000 - 30 000 tons & 1-5GW & 20 - 150 Billion \\
SPS via arbitrarily large phased array & Large array of small modules which captures and transmits energy from GEO & Highly Scalable and modular system  & 1-10km & 10 000 - 100 000 tons & 1-10GW & 20 - 500 Billion \\
Space based reflectors & Solar Reflectors in GEO, LEO, L1 or L2, that reflect sunlight to a specific point on Earth. It does not directly generate power, it redirects sunlight to places in need, which can include solar farms & Highly scalable & meters to several km & 10-50 tons & Boosts solar farms by +10% & 0.5-1 billion \\
Inflatable thin-film structures & Lightweight inflatable strunctures used to deploy large thin refelctors, solar arrays. Could be used for power generation, reflecting sunglight or even radiation sheilding & Multi-Purpose, easy deployment & hundreds of meters & A few tons & MW - GW & 10 - 100 million \\
Hypermodular SBSP designs & Extremely modular design which allows for easy scalability and incremental expansion & Highly Scalable, Modular, expansion by part & km & 10 000 - 100 000 tons & GW & 50 - 500 billion \\
Tethered satellite systems & Modular satellites which can be connected via long tethers in GEO & Highly Scalable, reduces the need of large rigid structures & Several  & 10 000 - 50 000 tons & 1-5 GW & 100 - 500 million \\
